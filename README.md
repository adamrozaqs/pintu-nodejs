# pintu-nodejs

Hai first off all in here i use Docker and manifest to deploy on Minikube
the simple app using node js 
and for github action iam using self-hosted runner
why im using that technology?
cause i can make easy for container image using Docker so it will be easy for deploy in minikube or kubernetes in public cloud
and why iam using selfhosted runner cause its more be secure for value or something cred and manageablle for future
why im using simple manifest for deploy ya cause its simple but if we wanna more secure we can use helm for deploy 

Thank you~~
